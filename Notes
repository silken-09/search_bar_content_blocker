    Potential Changes:  
        Submit button:
            If keeping:
                Prevent window from closing if user hasn't submitted changes
                Have SUBMIT BUTTON light up if a change has been made
                Make SUBMIT BUTTON unclickable if no changes have been made
                    Probably unnecessary
            If removing:
                Submit each individual change when PLUS/DELETE button is clicked

        createTestRE(arr):
            Insert \W* between every two characters

        Options Page/Customizations:
            Page reload:
                Currently, after the search bar is cleared, the page reloads (LOCATION.RELOAD()) because the search suggestions remain on some sites (e.g., Amazon) if I only set the SEARCHBAR.TEXTCONTENT = '';
                    Could allow this to be one of multiple options that the user can choose
                        Other options:
                            Just erase text (no LOCATION.RELOAD())
                            Return to homepage (LOCATION.ORIGIN())
                            Close tab
                            Redirect to different URL
                                LOCATION.REPLACE()
                                DECLARATIVE NET REQUEST
                            Alert
                                Custom message
                            Alert with option to dismiss/continue (like screentime app)

            Grouping:
                Allow the user to assign one outcome to multiple strings or URLs
                    Examples:
                        Example 1:
                            For strings "stringA", "stringB", "stringC":
                                Just erase content and reload page
                            For strings "stringD", "stringE", "stringF":
                                Erase content and dismissable alert
                        Example 2:
                            If user searches one of the strings on youtube.com or google videos, redirect URL to homepage or designated video
                    Could use drag + drop
            Toggling on/off:
                Allow user to allow individual strings to be searched without having to delete them from the list

            Separate sections for URLS (DECLARATIVE NET REQUEST) and search terms:
                Think it could be confusing to have them all together
                    
            Everything in the Options Page/Customizations outline regarding search terms can be considered for URLs/DECLARATIVE NET REQUEST

        Alternative to Options Page:
            Could try to use hidden DIVs that expand when a button held in the LIST ITEM is clicked on
